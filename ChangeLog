hibenchmarks (1.7.0) - 2017-07-16

 * hibenchmarks is still spreading fast

   we are at 320.000 users and 132.000 servers

   Almost 100k new users, 52k new installations and 800k docker pulls
   since the previous release, 4 and a half months ago.

   hibenchmarks user base grows at about 1000 new users and 600 new servers
   per day. Thank you. You are awesome.

 * The next release (v1.8) will be focused on providing a global health
   monitoring service, for all hibenchmarks users, for free.

 * hibenchmarks is now a (very fast) fully featured statsd server and the
   only one with automatic visualization: push a statsd metric and hit
   F5 on the hibenchmarks dashboard: your metric visualized. It also supports
   synthetic charts, defined by you, so that you can correlate and
   visualize your application the way you like it.

 * hibenchmarks got new installation options
   It is now easier than ever to install hibenchmarks - we also distribute a
   statically linked hibenchmarks x86_64 binary, including key dependencies
   (like bash, curl, etc) that can run everywhere a Linux kernel runs
   (CoreOS, CirrOS, etc).

 * metrics streaming and replication has been improved significantly.
   All known issues have been solved and key enhancements have been added.
   Headless collectors and proxies can now send metrics to backends when
   data source = as collected.

 * backends have got quite a few enhancements, including host tags and
   metrics filtering at the hibenchmarks side;
   prometheus support has been re-written to utilize more prometheus
   features and provide more flexibility and integration options.

 * hibenchmarks now monitors ZFS (on Linux and FreeBSD), ElasticSearch,
   RabbitMQ, Go applications (via expvar), ipfw (on FreeBSD 11), samba,
   squid logs (with web_log plugin).

 * hibenchmarks dashboard loading times have been improved significantly
   (hit F5 a few times on a hibenchmarks dashboard - it is now amazingly fast),
   to support dashboards with thousands of charts.

 * hibenchmarks alarms now support custom hooks, so you can run whatever you
   like in parallel with hibenchmarks alarms.

 * As usual, this release brings dozens of more improvements, enhancements
   and compatibility fixes.


hibenchmarks (1.6.0) - 2017-03-20

             Thank you!
          You are awesome!

 * central hibenchmarks is here

   This is the first release that supports real-time streaming of
   metrics between hibenchmarks servers.

   hibenchmarks can now be:

   - autonomous host monitoring
     (like it always has been)

   - headless data collector
     (collect and stream metrics in real-time to another hibenchmarks)

   - headless proxy
     (collect metrics from multiple hibenchmarks and stream them to another hibenchmarks)

   - store and forward proxy
     (like headless proxy, but with a local database)

   - central database
     (metrics from multiple hosts are aggregated)

   metrics databases can be configured on all nodes and each node maintaining
   a database may have a different retention policy and possibly run
   (even different) alarms on them.

 * monitoring ephemeral nodes

   hibenchmarks now supports monitoring autoscaled ephemeral nodes,
   that are started and stopped on demand (their IP is not known).

   When the ephemeral nodes start streaming metrics to the central
   hibenchmarks, the central hibenchmarks will show register them at "my-hibenchmarks"
   menu on the dashboard.

   For more information check:
   https://github.com/firehol/hibenchmarks/wiki/monitoring-ephemeral-nodes

 * monitoring ephemeral containers and VM guests

   hibenchmarks now cleans up container, guest VM, network interfaces and mounted
   disk metrics, disabling automatically their alarms too.

   For more information check:
   https://github.com/firehol/hibenchmarks/wiki/monitoring-ephemeral-containers

 * apps.plugin ported for FreeBSD

   @vlvkobal has ported "apps.plugin" to FreeBSD. hibenchmarks can now provide
   "Applications", "Users" and "User Groups" on FreeBSD.

 * web_log plugin

   @l2isbad has done a wonderful job creating a unified web log parsing plugin
   for all kinds of web server logs. With it, hibenchmarks provides real-time
   performance information and health monitoring alarms for web applications
   and web sites!

   For more information check:
   https://github.com/firehol/hibenchmarks/wiki/The-spectacles-of-a-web-server-log-file

 * backends

   hibenchmarks can now archive metrics to `JSON` backends
   (both push, by @lfdominguez, and pull modes).

 * IPMI monitoring

   hibenchmarks now has an IPMI plugin (based on freeipmi)
   for monitoring server hardware.

   The plugin creates (up to) 8 charts:

    1. number of sensors by state
    2. number of events in SEL
    3. Temperatures CELCIUS
    4. Temperatures FAHRENHEIT
    5. Voltages
    6. Currents
    7. Power
    8. Fans

   It also supports alarms (including the number of sensors in critical state).

   For more information, check:
